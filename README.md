## Objectives of This Project

#### 1. To gain experience using a team-based software development platform, Github
  * This will be attractive to employers looking for someone to work well in a team-bases development environment
  * Your Github contributions will show on your résumé

#### 2. To learn to use the coding language python
  * knowing how to use python in the correct manner is a very useful skill
  * knowing how to document and comment any code is essesntial to software development

#### 3. To learn to use a Data Science platform, Jupyter Notebook
  * Jupyter notebook could be very useful for certain projects as it's uses include numerical simulation, visulisations, machine learning and more
  * Jupyter is perfect for careers in data science because it uses languages popular in data science and not just python

#### 4. To Prepare you for your A-Levels
  * The content is based on A-Levels to integrate it with the school syllabus, this will save time in a densely packed school week
